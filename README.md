This is my web resume as well as a personal playground to try some new things in Nuxt.
Currently there are some hidden routes that will be tied together into demos here soon.

Input form plugin (`/plugins/input-form`)
<br />
Checkout form plugin (`/plugins/checkout-form`)
<br />
Shop plugin (`plugins/shop`)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
